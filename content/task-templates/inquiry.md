# <TASK-NNN>: <short title -- phrase it as the question>

> **Type `inquiry`.** A question to answer. What this task produces is an
> **answer**, not an alteration. Reviews, investigations, comparisons,
> feasibility questions and "find out whether" all live here.
>
> An inquiry that turns out to need work done does not become that work: it
> finishes with its answer, and the work it recommends is filed as its own
> task or tasks. That is the discipline that stops an inquiry from quietly
> turning into an unbounded project.
>
> Leave `## Blocker` empty unless this task is in `blocked/`. When it is,
> that section must say three things: what is blocking it, who or what
> would unblock it, and when to check back.
>
> Before starting, read `.claude/task-rules.md` and `.claude/done-gate.md`.
> The done-gate, not this file, defines what *verified* means here.

## Question

State it as one answerable question. If you cannot phrase it as a question,
this is probably a `change` in disguise.

>

## Why it matters

What decision waits on the answer, and who is waiting? An inquiry whose
answer changes nothing is an inquiry worth closing instead of running.

## Time box

Investigations expand to fill whatever room they are given, so give this one
a limit up front and honour it.

- **Limit:** <a duration, or a date>
- **If the limit is reached without an answer:** report what is known, what
  is still open, and what it would take to close the gap. That is a complete
  outcome, not a failure -- record it and close the task.

## Method

How the question will be answered, and against what. Sources, comparisons,
who will be asked, what will be examined.

1.
2.

## Deliverable

Where the answer goes when it exists. If the answer belongs somewhere more
durable than this task -- a decision of record, a written finding, a note in
a reference document -- name that destination here, and file a `record` task
for it if it needs to outlive this ledger.

- **The answer will be written in:** <`## Findings` below / `<destination>`>

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The question above is answered in `## Findings`, or the answer is
      stated to be unreachable within the time box, with what is missing.
- [ ] Every follow-on the answer implies is filed as its own task, listed in
      `## Findings`.
- [ ] The done-gate passes (`.claude/done-gate.md`), with the evidence
      recorded in `## Notes`.

## Findings

The answer. Written here as the work proceeds, not reconstructed at the end.
Separate what you established from what you inferred, and say which is
which.

**Answer:**

**Established:**

-

**Inferred, with the reasoning:**

-

**Still open:**

-

**Follow-on tasks filed:**

- `<TASK-NNN>` -- <what it covers>
